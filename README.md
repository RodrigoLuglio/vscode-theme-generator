## 🧬 Color Generation Algorithm

Our algorithm creates harmonious color schemes by:

1. Selecting a base color
2. Generating complementary and analogous colors
3. Adjusting saturation and brightness for optimal contrast
4. Applying color theory principles for visual appeal

## 🔯 Sacred Geometry Color Schemes

One of our standout features is the use of sacred geometry patterns to create visually stunning and harmonious color schemes. These patterns, derived from ancient mathematical principles, include:

- Flower of Life
- Fibonacci Spiral
- Golden Ratio
- Platonic Solids
- Sri Yantra

Each pattern is used to generate a unique color palette that resonates with the underlying mathematical harmony found in nature. This approach ensures that your themes are not only aesthetically pleasing but also grounded in timeless design principles.

### How it works:

1. Select a sacred geometry pattern
2. The algorithm maps colors to specific points or sections of the pattern
3. Color relationships are determined based on their positions within the pattern
4. The resulting palette is applied to your VSCode theme

This feature allows for the creation of themes that are both visually appealing and conceptually meaningful.

## 🏷️ Semantic Tokens

We use semantic tokens to provide consistent and meaningful syntax highlighting across various programming languages and file types.

## 🎛️ Theme Controls

- Switch between light and dark modes
- Choose from predefined color schemes
- Adjust UI and syntax color saturation
- Regenerate unlocked colors
- Regenerate ANSI colors

## 🔓 Color Locking

Lock specific colors to prevent them from changing during theme regeneration, allowing for fine-tuned control over your theme.

## 👁️ Live Preview

Use the built-in Monaco editor to preview your theme in real-time with sample code snippets in various languages.
